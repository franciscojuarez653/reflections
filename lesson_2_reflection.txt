What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a new repository is initialized git creates a hidden folder named .git which contains all the meta-data that will be used to track the files history,
commits and all data required by Git to track changes in the directory. If you don't initialize the repository you won't be able to keep the version control 
of the files contained in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the respository as it is a "connection" between them. The value that the staging area offers is
that you can control which files (and changes) to commit and in a given case it allows you to prepare the updates from the working directory files to the actual 
repository version tracking.

change?
